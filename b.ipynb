So to start and succeed this project must be resolved, and that is to analyze the Pizza storesâ€™ locations in the major US cities and find the best place for our tourist . Our main target are tourists with a taste of western style pizza.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data section**\n\nI will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of Pizza stores in 5 major US cities which are: New York,NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago,IL. These are one of the most populated US cities and I am hopeful that they will contain the best Pizza places in the US.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Methodology**\n\nour  main target here is to asses which city would have the highest Pizza store density , we participated in using the Four Square API through the venues channel.In addition we took advantage of near query to get venues cities.Also with the CategoryID purpose to set it to show only pizza places.An examples of my requests following with the help of this link:\nhttps://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=&client_secret=&v=20180605&New York, NY&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735\n\nThat 4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735 is the Id of the Pizza Place Category. Also, Foursquare limits us to maximum of 100 venues per query.\n\nMoreover, I repeated this request for the 5 studied cities and got their top 100 venues. I saved the name and coordinate data only from the result and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.\n\nNext, to get an indicator of the density of Pizza Places, I calculated a center coordinate of the venues to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then I calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
